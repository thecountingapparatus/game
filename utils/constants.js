  Letter: [
    "1) Count as high as possible using letters instead of numbers.",
    "2) Milestones occur every string of Z's, and subtracts from effective milestones.",
    "3) Unlock functions by hitting their unlock string EXACTLY. Functions are not retroactively unlocked.",
    "4) Type \"suggest <function_name>\" to create a suggestion which will be manually reviewed."

  X_X: [
    "1)  Using only X of a number X; e.g 1 1's, 2 2's, etc.; solve for your next count to count as high as possible.",
    "2)  Milestones occur every X to the Xth power and bans the X most used functions, then increments raw X.",
    "3)  Challenge C unlock when the average of all factions and their challenges hits the Cth multiple of 500.",
    "3a) Your base game, and all odd numbered challenges, are calculated in degrees rather than radians.",
    "3b) Challenge Counts dynamically reduce global milestone scaling, which is weakened based on effective milestones.\n",
